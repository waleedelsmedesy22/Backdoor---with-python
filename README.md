# Backdoor & Listener (Python) — Defensive / Educational Lab Project

## Overview
This repository is a **template** for understanding how backdoor–listener
communication works **only in a controlled, educational environment**.
It provides documentation and structure — **no malicious code is included**.

The goal is to help security students and blue-teamers learn:
- How a typical backdoor/listener architecture communicates.
- How to detect and defend against such threats.

---

## ⚠️ Legal & Safety Notice
Running or distributing real backdoors is **illegal and unethical**.  
This repository **does not** contain any code to create or operate a backdoor.  
Use it only for defensive security education or research with full, explicit permission.

---

## What this repo provides
- Detailed README explaining the project’s educational purpose.
- `requirements.txt` listing Python libraries that might be useful for **detection** or for safe simulations.
- `LICENSE` (MIT) for open educational use.
- `listener_lab.py.example` — placeholder for a *defensive* listener simulation (no real remote code execution).
- `backdoor_lab.py.example` — placeholder describing how an attacker-controlled client might behave (concept only, no payload).

---

## Suggested Lab Features (Conceptual Only)
- Simulate how a listener waits for connections in a safe, isolated network.
- Demonstrate detection techniques: network intrusion detection, firewall rules, endpoint monitoring.
- Provide alerts when unexpected connections are attempted.

*(No backdoor functionality or shell access is provided.)*

## Requirements (for defensive lab experimentation)
If you later add **detection** or benign simulation code, these Python packages may be helpful:
- socket (Python standard library) — for simple network communication in a lab.
- rich — for colored terminal output.
- psutil — for monitoring connections and processes.

See `requirements.txt` for pinned versions.

---

## Usage (High-level, non-actionable)
1. Create an isolated lab network or VM environment.
2. Implement **defensive** detection or safe simulation logic inside the placeholder files.
3. Document results and lessons learned.
